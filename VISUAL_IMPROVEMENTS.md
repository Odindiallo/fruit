# FreshFruit Paradise - Visual Improvements

## âœ… Visual Issues Fixed

### **1. Hero Statistics Animation** - FIXED
**Problem:** Statistics showed inconsistent numbers between screenshots
**Solution:** Improved animation system with better timing and staggering
- Added `animationTriggered` flag to prevent multiple executions
- Implemented staggered animations (200ms delay between stats)
- Improved visibility detection for immediate triggering
- Added separate `animateNumber()` method for cleaner code
- Fixed timing issues with proper duration calculation

### **2. Fruit Card Styling** - ENHANCED
**Problem:** Cards appeared basic and could be more visually appealing
**Solution:** Comprehensive visual enhancement system
- Added gradient top border on hover (`linear-gradient(90deg, primary, secondary)`)
- Enhanced hover effects with color transitions
- Added border styling (`1px solid var(--gray-200)`)
- Improved fruit name color change on hover (to primary color)
- Enhanced description color transition on hover
- Added proper z-index layering for visual effects

### **3. Color Scheme & Contrast** - IMPROVED
**Problem:** Some areas appeared too dark or had poor contrast
**Solution:** Balanced color scheme with better visual hierarchy
- Lightened hero background gradient (reduced opacity to 0.08)
- Added radial gradient overlays for subtle visual interest
- Improved fruits section background with gradient transitions
- Enhanced hero content positioning with proper z-index
- Added better background layering for depth

### **4. Responsive Layout** - OPTIMIZED
**Problem:** Layout issues on different screen sizes
**Solution:** Comprehensive responsive design system
- **Fruits Grid:**
  - Mobile (â‰¤768px): Single column layout
  - Tablet (769px-1200px): 2 columns
  - Desktop (â‰¥1201px): 3 columns with max-width 1400px
- **Nutrition Grid:** Responsive breakpoints for better content flow
- **Typography Scaling:**
  - Mobile hero title: 2.5rem (from larger desktop size)
  - Responsive section titles: 2rem on mobile
  - Optimized card image heights: 180px on mobile
- **Spacing Improvements:**
  - Better padding and margins for mobile
  - Improved grid gaps on smaller screens
